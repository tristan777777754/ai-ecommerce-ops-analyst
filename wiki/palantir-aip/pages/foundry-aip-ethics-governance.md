# AI ethics and governance

At Palantir, we believe that responsible AI is not an afterthought. Rather, it is fundamental to how we build technology. Our approach centers on developing software that enables responsible AI use throughout the entire system lifecycle, recognizing that ethical considerations extend beyond model development alone to encompass the full technology system, from data foundations and processing pipelines to user interfaces and human decision-making workflows. Rather than treating ethical considerations as separate compliance requirements, our platform integrates responsible AI capabilities throughout the development lifecycle.

This document outlines how Palantir's AI platform (AIP) actively supports eight core themes of responsible AI development. Each theme represents not just a principle, but a set of concrete capabilities and workflows designed to help users build trustworthy AI systems that are responsible, ethically sound, and effective in practice. This comprehensive approach ensures that users have the tools and workflows needed to address responsible AI requirements systematically, whether they are working with traditional machine learning models or generative AI systems.

***

## Equitable: Fair, unbiased, non-discriminatory

*AI systems should be inclusive and accessible and should not result in unfair discrimination against individuals or groups.*

### Platform capabilities

AIP offers features for identifying sources of bias in data, evaluating models for bias, and monitoring fairness concerns during model use.

* [**Sensitive Data Scanner**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/sensitive-data-scanner/overview/) can automatically identify protected attributes and potential bias sources in datasets, enabling proactive assessment of fairness risks before they impact model training, evaluation, or use.
* [**Subset evaluation in Modeling Objectives**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/evaluate-models/model-evaluation-automatic/#configure-evaluation-subsets) allows systematic evaluation of model performance across different groups within an evaluation dataset, surfacing potential disparate impacts that aggregate metrics might hide. For example, subset evaluation can be used to run model evaluation and easily compare model performance across demographic groups in an evaluation dataset.
* [**AIP Evals**](foundry-aip-evals-overview.md) allows you to evaluate the performance of AIP Logic functions across diverse test cases. With experiments in AIP Evals, users can further adjust input parameters to the model to understand how changes in certain inputs to the model might change the model's response.
* [**Data health monitoring**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/health-checks/overview/) provides ongoing assessment of data representativeness and quality, helping identify when datasets may systematically under- or over-represent specific populations.

### Implementation workflow

Teams can identify fairness risks early in their data preparation process using Sensitive Data Scanner and data health monitoring to detect protected attributes and imbalances in their data foundation before model development begins. This addresses potential bias at the data level. However, bias can also emerge from the model itself even with high-quality data, so both subset evaluation through Modeling Objectives and AIP Evals provides systematic testing to detect unequal model performance across demographic groups. When bias is detected at either level, teams can implement targeted mitigation strategies such as re-sampling, collecting additional representative data, or adjusting algorithmic approaches.

## Explainable: Interpretable, understandable, transparent

*AI systems should not be black boxes. Instead, to build trust in AI systems, users should understand how they work as much as possible.*

### Platform capabilities

AIP provides tools to help users understand how AI systems work, from debugging generative AI reasoning to evaluating traditional model performance.

* The [**Modeling Objectives evaluation dashboard**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/evaluate-models/review-model-metrics/) provides detailed model interpretability through feature importance analysis, performance breakdowns, and evaluation results that can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* [**AIP Evals**](foundry-aip-evals-ontology-edits.md) enables systematic testing and evaluation with both default and custom evaluation libraries, allowing teams to assess model behavior in ways that align with their specific domain requirements.
* [**AIP Logic tools**](foundry-logic-overview.md) enable delegation of specific tasks to purpose-built, interpretable tools rather than relying solely on LLM processing, creating more explainable AI systems through composable, auditable components.
* [**AIP Logic debug view**](foundry-logic-core-concepts.md#debugging) provides visibility into chain-of-thought reasoning and tool orchestration within LLM-based systems, showing how the system delegates tasks and makes decisions through transparent handoffs to explainable components.
* [**AIP observability**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/aip-observability/overview/) delivers thorough monitoring and debugging capabilities across AI workflows, providing detailed execution traces, performance metrics, and system behavior insights that help teams understand and troubleshoot their AI systems.

### Implementation workflow

Version control systems automatically capture model development decisions and rationale throughout the development process. For generative AI systems, the debug view in AIP Logic provides real-time visibility into how LLMs orchestrate tasks and delegate to explainable tools, while AIP observability delivers comprehensive execution traces that help teams understand system behavior. Teams can design more transparent systems by using AIP Logic tools to delegate specific tasks to interpretable components rather than relying solely on LLM processing. Testing and evaluation approaches through AIP Evals and Modeling Objectives complement these capabilities by presenting model performance metrics in formats accessible to both technical teams and business stakeholders.

* [**Georestrictions**](foundry-aip-supported-llms.md#llm-availability-by-geography) ensure that model requests and responses remain within specified jurisdictions, supporting regulatory compliance requirements across different regions and legal frameworks.
* [**Encryption at rest and transit**](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/security/protect-data-connector-installation/#data-encryption) is a core part of our shared security responsibility model, with additional advanced capabilities for data protection that can be applied throughout the AI development lifecycle.
* [**Capacity limits**](foundry-aip-llm-capacity-management.md) enable administrators to manage LLM usage and prevent service disruptions from unexpected load spikes, ensuring robust and stable AI workflows even under variable demand conditions.

### Implementation workflow

Access controls and data markings establish security boundaries from the outset, with georestrictions ensuring that model requests and responses remain within compliant jurisdictions. Encryption at rest and in transit protects information throughout the AI development lifecycle. Model deployments and pre-release functions can enforce staged testing procedures before production release, while capacity limits prevent service disruptions from unexpected LLM usage spikes. Real-time monitoring systems provide continuous oversight across security, performance, and operational metrics, with rollback capabilities enabling immediate response when issues are detected.

## Getting started with responsible AI

Palantir's AI platform makes responsible AI systematic rather than ad hoc. The platform guides users of all skill levels and domains of expertise through established workflows that incorporate responsible AI principles:

1. **Focus on the fully integrated system, not just its component tools:** Consider your AI system holistically, from data foundations and processing pipelines through user interfaces and human decision-making workflows. Use capabilities like Data Lineage and Pipeline Builder to understand how components connect across your system.
2. **Acknowledge technology's limits:** Begin with a clear assessment of what your AI system can and cannot do, and what it should and should not be permitted to do. Use problem-first modeling approaches to define appropriate scope and limitations before development begins.
3. **Do not solve problems that should not be solved:** Evaluate whether your use case is appropriate for AI intervention. Consider legal, ethical, and community norms before initiating development. Some problems may be technically feasible but inappropriate for mathematical optimization.
4. **Adhere to methodological best practices for sound data science:** Leverage the platform's built-in evaluation frameworks, bias detection capabilities, and fairness assessment tools. Use Sensitive Data Scanner to identify protected attributes, employ subset evaluation to assess disparate impacts, and follow established methodologies for responsible feature usage.
5. **Keep AI responsible, accountable, and oriented towards humans:** Design AI systems that enhance rather than replace human decision-making. Use Ontology-based decision support, human oversight workflows, and feedback loops to ensure AI recommendations complement human judgment while maintaining clear accountability through audit trails and approval workflows.
6. **Promote multi-stakeholder engagement:** Configure checks and approval workflows that match your organization's governance structure. Use collaborative tools like Workshop and role-based permissions to ensure domain experts, compliance officers, technical teams, and other stakeholders contribute their expertise throughout the AI lifecycle.
7. **Ensure technical, governance, and cultural awareness:** Combine the platform's technical capabilities (encryption, access controls, monitoring) with governance frameworks (approval workflows, audit trails) and cultural practices (training, stakeholder engagement) to create inclusive responsible AI practices that fit your organizational context.

## Conclusion

Responsible AI is not a constraint on innovation. Instead, it is what makes AI systems trustworthy enough to use for critical decisions. Palantir embeds responsible AI principles into every aspect of the development lifecycle, enabling organizations to build AI systems that are not just technically sophisticated, but ethically sound and operationally reliable.

By taking an integrated approach that considers the full context of AI deployment, we help our users solve their most challenging problems while enabling them to maintain the highest standards of responsibility and governance.
